# Knyte, an experimental chess (micro-) platform

This is a training-purpose project.

## Motivation

Motivations include:

- Training some new skills concerning unit testing,
- Training writing loosely-coupled code:
  - Isolating domain from the rest,
  - Employing pure DI,
- Training some new DDD-related skills:
  - Trying a domain model by putting logic to business entities instead of service (avoiding "anemic" model).

> When it comes to the point concerning the domain model, it was my very intention to choose chess. Although it might be clichéd and thus a little bit boring, this seems to require certain logic, as opposed to a simple CRUD-like app (it might be, though, interesting to make this CRUD-, that is, REST-compliant!). I also needed to choose something clichéd to prevent my obsession of developing it too much towards various over-creative directions or whatnot.
